I am graduate student at [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). Before joining MIT, I obtained dual Bachelor's degrees in Urban Planning and Economics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), China. I am pursuing the Master of Science in Transportation (MST) degree at [JTL Urban Mobility Lab](https://mobility.mit.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of behavioral science, economics, and transportation. I try to combine machine learning and econometrics methods to address urban transportation issues, such as congestion and pollution. I am currently working as a research assistant at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology ([SMART](https://smart.mit.edu/research/m3s/about-m3s)), focusing on the environmental, social, and economic impacts of artificial intelligence.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Jinhua Zhao](https://dusp.mit.edu/people/jinhua-zhao) from [Department of Urban Studies and Planning](https://dusp.mit.edu/), MIT. At Peking University, I was advised by [Prof. Liyan Xu](https://www.cala.pku.edu.cn/info/1025/1275.htm) from [College of Architecture and Landscape](https://www.cala.pku.edu.cn/index.htm).
