The disorderly driving behavior of electric bicycles at urban road intersections has 
been a concern for law enforcement departments, but there are few studies on the driving behavior 
rules of electric bicycles. Taking Jiangbei District of Ningbo City as an example, this study 
uses video surveillance data to classify and identify e-bikes, extract their trajectories, 
and employs spatial data analysis methods to examine the driving characteristics of e-bikes at road 
intersections and the influence of environmental factors on them.

This project is my undergraduate research project at Peking University, supported by the President's 
Fund of Peking University. This project was supervised by Prof. Xu Liyan.
