This project was my undergraduate capstone design at Peking University. I utilized 
various sources of geospatial big data to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns 
of residents’ nighttime travel in Beijing, exploring the relationship between the built 
environment and night travel behavior. The project earned third place in the Second Urban 
and Rural Planning Graduation Design Competition organized by China’s Ministry of Natural 
Resources.
